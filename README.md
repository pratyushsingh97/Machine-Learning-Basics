# Machine-Learning-Basics
I worked on a **Machine Learning Basics** blog post for my team at IBM, and I thought I should share it with everybody!
---
These blogs try to explain six main concepts:
1. Hyperparameter Optimization
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 
3. Feature Engineering
4. Ensemble Models Overview 
5. Performance Measures
6. Train vs. Test Split 

These blogs are intended to be high-level and purposefully skip details. I apologize to any machine learning instructors or practictioners in advance if something is not *technically* correct. 

Let me know if you see any mistakes or room for improvement :). Feel free to reach me at: pratyush.singh97@gmail.com
